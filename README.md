# Fretboard App

A python app for the terminal to help drill notes on the first 12 frets of a guitar on all 6 strings.

It works like this:
- the app prompts for a string and a fret. For example "2nd string, 7th fret"
- you play the note on the guitar and say the name of the note

The app is written to guarantee that all 6 strings and all 12 frets are prompted for at least once per cycle. That is to say, in 6 prompts you will have to play all 6 strings, and in 12 prompts you will have to use all 12 frets. It also uses randomises the voices so that it doesn't get _too_ repetitive.

It continues infinitely until you hit `ctrl-c`, whereupon it prints the number of exercises completed.


## Usage

```shell
$ python fretboard.py

# custom delay of 12s between prompts
$ python fretboard.py 12
```

## Config

The app is only intended to run on MacOS (it uses the `say` command).

Voices have been selected for the clearest pronunciation, but you can edit the code to add any other voices you want.
